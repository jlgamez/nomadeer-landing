# Business Context for GitHub Copilot

## What the Business Is About

We are building a **new category of live audio-guided tours**.  
Unlike pre-recorded audio guides or traditional group tours, our product offers **real-time storytelling from expert guides**, delivered directly through your phone.  
The goal is to make **private, personalized, and flexible tours** accessible to everyone—whether they are exploring a new city or rediscovering their own area.

## Key Benefits

- **Private & Personal** – No awkward groups. The guide speaks only to you (or your small group).
- **Affordable Exclusivity** – Experience private guiding without luxury prices.
- **Freedom & Comfort** – Explore at your own pace while still having a live expert at your side (virtually).
- **Story-Driven Experience** – More than facts: guides connect you to history, culture, and meaning through compelling storytelling.
- **Anywhere Access** – Guides can be remote, so tours are available even when local experts aren’t.

## How It Works

1. **Browse & Book** – Choose a tour experience in the app.
2. **Join the Session** – At the scheduled time, open the app and connect with your guide via live audio.
3. **Explore Freely** – The guide narrates, answers questions (if enabled), and directs you as you walk.
4. **End When You Want** – You can stop anytime, or extend if you want more.

Think of it as **“live guided podcasts you walk through.”**

## Landing Page Optimization Focus

- **Clear Value Proposition** (above the fold): “Private live tours. Anywhere. Affordable.”
- **Strong Call to Action**: Single, obvious waitlist signup.
- **Emotional Storytelling**: Position the product as more meaningful than generic tours.
- **Social Proof Ready**: Space for testimonials, guide highlights, or sample stories.
- **Visual Simplicity**: Hero section with bold headline, clean CTA, minimal distractions.
